# VBA Stock Analysis Challenge

This VBA Challenge focuses on analyzing multi-year stock data using a VBA script. The goal is to create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and produces key information in respective columns:

## Information to be Extracted:

- **Ticker Symbol:** The unique identifier for each stock.
- **Yearly Change:** The difference between the opening price at the beginning of a given year and the closing price at the end of that year.
- **Percentage Change:** The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- **Total Stock Volume:** The total stock volume of the stock.

## Process:

1. Loop through all the stocks for a specific year.
2. Calculate the yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume for each stock.
3. Populate the respective columns with the calculated values.
4. Apply conditional formatting to the Yearly Change and Percent Change columns to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.

## Bonus Activity:

Added functionality to the script to identify and return the stocks with the:

- **Greatest % Increase**
- **Greatest % Decrease**
- **Greatest Total Volume**

The script has been executed in all three years' of data (2018, 2019, and 2020). Refer to the attached Word document for result screenshots.
